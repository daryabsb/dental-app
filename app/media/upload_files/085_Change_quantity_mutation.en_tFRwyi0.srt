1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,640
In this video we will add a change quantity features so the user can change the quantity of the product.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,410
Let's add to our index DOJ as in creating a new mutation function.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,870
So go here and you want to go to Index project and scroll down to your mutations and we want to add

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,520
a new mutation function which will be change quantity and if we want to add the note up here of what

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,010
is the algorithm.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,740
So the first step is to find the product in the car.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,650
And then second is to change the quantity of the product.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:44,240
Once we have found the protein core and then we want to update the length of the cart and finally we

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,900
want to replace the old product with the updated product.

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:59,410
So let's write down in change quantity you want to pass in state and then product and then the quantity

11
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,410
we're going to get this quantity from the front end.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:11,660
So let's find the product in the cart first go to state DOT cart not find an import product and describe

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,370
the equivalent to product.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,140
I do.

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,510
And then after that we want to cart product dot quantity equals to quantity

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,100
so it should be first step second step.

17
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:34,620
And now is the third step is to update the length of the cart so we can just copy this and it's not

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,500
a good idea to actually copy the same thing that have been written over and over again.

19
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,400
But we just want to test it first.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,240
Then only we can refactor this and put it in a separate function.

21
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,690
And last thing we want to replace the old product with the updated product.

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,170
So let index of product equals to state that cart the index off cart product.

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,150
And we're going to get the index of the product in the cart and then you want to do splice so we can

24
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:11,060
replace the old product with the updated product so state that cart does splice an index of product

25
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,010
that we want to pass in the cart product.

26
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,850
So now we can call this you know a front end which is in cart of you pitch.

27
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:26,410
So now let's head back to a cart of you and you want to find a select which is the quantity select and

28
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,330
the first thing we want is we want to loop this so that we'll have more than one quantity so we can

29
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:40,770
choose 1 2 or 3 and 4 before I in list keep it maximum 10 key will be I.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,570
And then the value will be I.

31
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:52,010
And then this will be save this let's go back to our chrome check the quantity.

32
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,300
Then now we have more than one quantity we can choose 1 2 3 4 5 6.

33
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,740
Until then and then let's go back and let's implement a function where we can actually call the mutation

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,300
function.

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,030
So you want to add methods here and then on change quantity

36
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,720
now you pass an event and product.

37
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,510
And they wanted to let equals to quantity equals event not target not value.

38
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:29,560
So by doing event on target of value we can access the value of the option which will be if you go back

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,230
to select we can access the value of the specific option tap.

40
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,830
So now we want to do this.

41
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,960
That store

42
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:50,970
change quantity and we passing product in as well as the quantity.

43
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,680
So we can actually call the REC lead mutation function the reason why I don't want to put it in action

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
because it's just one line.

45
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,350
So I think it's better because it is directly called the mutation function here.

46
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,220
And let's call this unchanged quantity you know select in select.

47
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:15,020
You want to do at change because you on change quantity and then you have to pass in the event parameter

48
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:24,190
and the product to save this and let's go and test it up let's go to Google Chrome refresh this page

49
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,910
and you can open up your view death to so that we can see the changes to state and then let's change

50
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,690
this quantity to five.

51
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,670
And it did change the price and as well as the total price.

52
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,920
But we have a problem.

53
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,450
If you can see the cart it shows 0 5 2.

54
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,470
Why is that.

55
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,610
If you go back to our Ed to data type for this value is actually the not a number is a string.

56
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,410
So to fix that you want to go here and we want to convert the string to I.A..

57
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,250
So the best way to do that is to type pass a..

58
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,560
So that you will convert the string into number because when string and numbers are added together it

59
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
will become a string.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,820
That's why it shows 0 5 2.

61
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,380
So as safeties and let's test it again So refresh and it can see it's still 0 5 2.

62
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,260
So we have to go to our application we have to remove the view X and we have to go back to Amazon and

63
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,360
refresh first.

64
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,520
And I want to click Harry Potter add to cart.

65
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,600
Let's go back here and click get more troops to CAR again.

66
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,600
Let's go back here and we change this to seven.

67
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,960
Now it worked because now it is not a string anymore it is.

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
It is a number.

69
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,430
So this is really amazing because if you change this quantity now the price will change in even a total

70
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,070
price.

71
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,280
And even though cart Lang as well.

72
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:55,070
But if we refresh the page this quantity will be back to one and one.

73
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,620
So how do we make it to the original quantity.

74
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,930
So let's go and to select.

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,900
We have to add a selected value here.

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:12,590
And for us to do that we need to create a small method which would be check quantity and product quantity

77
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,030
and the quantity that we got from the option.

78
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:28,370
And if we want to pass both of this equals to pass I.A. and even a quantity we want to pass return true

79
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,290
else.

80
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:39,230
We want to return false safeties and copiers and go back to shellac and let's pass the function here

81
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:48,830
and then pass in the product quantity and as well as the value I safeties and let's refresh the speech

82
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,320
and I can see now it shows the quantity that we chose so let's change it to seven.

83
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,150
And if you refresh it will be seven.

84
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,190
We have completed our quantity feature in this video.

85
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,120
So in the next video we will add the ability for the user to delete one of the products in the cart.

86
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,540
I'll see you guys in the next video.
