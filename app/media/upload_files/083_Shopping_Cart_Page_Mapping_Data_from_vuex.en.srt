1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,910
In this video we are going to map the cart object into view X and we're going to map it till a shopping

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,850
cart full.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,690
Go ahead and do that to go to you enter and you want to go to cart that view and down here you want

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:22,820
to type scrip and then you want to import get her map from view X but we haven't created the gather

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,750
for getting this cart seat.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,780
So we have to go the index of yes.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,790
And you want to type GET cart past the state and then we'll be return state DOT cart.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,590
Simple as that.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,170
And then now we can go back to cart a view and then we can create computed properties and then we can

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,890
type.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:49,300
Dot dot dot which is spread operator map getters and more call GET cart.

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,770
You can copy get a cart and find lists of the item which is this part.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:07,430
And now here you want to V for product in get cart past a key should be product dot undescribed D.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,410
And move and map all the data here.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,980
So product will be in here will be S or C should be colon.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,610
And then product Dot photo.

17
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,770
Now we have product title we change this to product

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,640
and then as we Product Owner so does we product dot owner name.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,540
And I would go down quantity.

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:47,370
This will handle this section later on that product price which will be product that price

21
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,650
and that's all you want to save it.

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,890
You want to go back and there we have it all the products we add.

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,000
So let's say we add a new product let's say we add another product would you be game of truant.

24
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,290
So if you add and add to cart and go back to a cart there would have to have two products in here.

25
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,370
But now we have to fix our price because the price is not thirty nine.

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,930
Price plus to be 29 times the quantity of the product.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,920
Speaker to go back and we get a good price that's fine.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,260
Price though we'll do a little bit of computation and we shall be program price times product dot quantity

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,390
save it and they we have it 1 9 5 which is correct because if you multiply twenty nine times five it

30
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,390
will be 1 9 5.

31
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,050
Now we haven't figure out how to accumulate the total price.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,090
So how do we do this.

33
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,960
So let's go back to our index Rojas file and then we have to type get cart.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,630
Total price pass in the state here and even a top let total equal to zero.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,480
We just want to compute all of the prices you know cart.

36
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,890
So if you compute one and five plus eighty nine it will be 2 8 4.

37
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:07,210
So we won that total price so let's go back and let's do state DOT cart dot map.

38
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:16,210
So we want to loop all the product end product and and we want it to total plus equals the product price

39
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:24,010
and then we have to multiply it with product dot quantity and after that you want to return the total

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,670
because we have to return it.

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,940
Now let's go back to World card the view let's go down and let's put here.

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,570
Get card.

43
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,100
Total price.

44
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,890
Let's see the name.

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,800
It is the same.

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,060
All right let's go back.

47
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,640
And now we can call this get card.

48
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,180
Total price getter.

49
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,160
And then we can set it to our total price.

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,790
We should be card into the price.

51
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,510
And then we can change this to get caught.

52
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,030
Total price.

53
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,180
So if we go back it will be two it four which is correct.

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:05,610
And I want to change this ninety nine to 2 8 4 as well so as find that sum total three are and then

55
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,700
get a card total price and it will be to it for as well.

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,420
And they want to change the subtotal to item to the total product in our card which is six.

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,100
So let's go back to our Ed and you want to go down and you want to call one more thing which is get

58
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,060
cart length and copy this.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,700
You want to find up to introduce to get cart length and let's find another subtotal.

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,520
Save it.

61
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,580
Let's go back.

62
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,940
Now we have supper all six items it goes to here as well.

63
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,990
So now if you refresh the page the whole product in the cart will disappear.

64
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,860
This is not the correct behavior that we won for our shopping cart feature.

65
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,340
We want the data to persist.

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,420
We're going to fix this in the next video.
