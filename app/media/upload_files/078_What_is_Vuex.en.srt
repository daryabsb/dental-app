1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,240
What is view X view X is a state management.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,750
When we have a single source of truth it is easier for all of the components to use.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,700
For example we implemented the logging beach when we were logging.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,730
We mutated the off state from logging falls to log true and if you realize we actually use the off state

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,050
user ID components like review beach nav bar and finally you use it in profile.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,490
He made our life easier when we have view X but only use view X if many of the components required to

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,870
use it to aspirin for.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,680
Off object.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,960
I would never bars like these.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,590
Hello.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,650
And then the user name and even the address of the user.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,930
We need to access the off object right.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,690
So it is easier if we can put it in one single source of truth and we can just communicate with that

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,850
data like even review page we need the object as well.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,880
And even profile we need to off object as well.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,960
Why do we have to replicate it in every single page or every single component.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,090
While we can put it in one single source of truth.

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,600
Just thing of state as giant big javascript object wherever you put it in the state.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,110
It will go to log off and after this we're going to have cart.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,790
So that is actually what is view x is just a giant javascript object.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,290
So for our art to cut feature to our components and pages that will need to access to car object.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,630
So we need to put a cart object in our state so as you can see first we have cart on the nav bar that

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,250
requires to communicate with the car object and then we have a another picture.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,270
We're going to create a future where you can review your order you can check like estimated delivery

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,470
and b load estimate delivery will be the cart content.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,660
So we need to communicate with the car object as well.

27
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,180
And then when we click Add to cart it has to communicate with the car object as well to increase the

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,750
number of products in the cart.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,080
And finally we have the obviously the cart page which we just created in pass video where this will

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,930
be all of your products in the cart.

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,880
As you can see there are a lot of pages in components that need to communicate with the car objects.

32
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,460
Hence why we need to put this car object in a view x so that all the components or pages can communicate

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,020
with that object.

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,140
So this is the diagram of what is view X. There's actions mutations date and view components.

35
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,530
So let's go through one by one.

36
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,900
So actions are when you click a button like when you update or add a product that is considered an action

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,310
an axis mutation.

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,340
Mutations are when you want to change the state.

39
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,270
So in this case when you click a button it will increase the cart Lane from zero to 10.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,110
Depends on how many products you add to the cart.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
So there is a mutation.

42
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,690
We mutate the cart Lane.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,600
So let me put it in a sentence when you click a button it will mutate the state and the view component

44
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,010
will re render the newly updated state.

45
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,070
Simple as that.

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,470
So here is add to cart and then this is the view X single source of truth as you can see there are states

47
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,780
like of cart and product quantity and then there are methods which you can add to cart.

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,690
It's not supposed to be methods supposed to be actions.

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,670
It's the same thing.

50
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,150
And as you can see this is the view x is just a huge javascript object.

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,580
Is off car and product quantity will be state actually method is actions to be honest.

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,160
We have a touch of you X when dealing with education.

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,450
We started off user object in a state.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,270
This is off now and once we actually log in it will change to object and then as log and true strategy

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,660
and in the user object in the next few days we will implement our view x.

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,360
So we're going to create a state and then we're going to create an action.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
