1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,340
Let's add a couple of products to our cart.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,730
Go to Amazon homepage and let's go to Harry Potter.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,450
Add to Cart and then if refresh it will disappear.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,430
There is a way to fix that problem but before that we need to fix one single problem before we meet

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,480
our view X persisted.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,400
So let's add the Harry Potter product I want to show you the book right now at the quantity increases.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,980
But if we go back to Amazon if we go back to Harry Potter and try to add you can see that it shows not

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,340
a number because it's updating the new product quantity not the old product.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,080
So in order for us to fix that we have to go back to View studio put index Rojas.

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:49,370
And you want to go to add product to cart and then in this L statement it has to be cart product or

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,860
else the quantity will be undefined.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,930
And if we saved is go back and refresh and add to cart it shows for.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,390
So if you go back to homepage and we go back to Harry Potter and then now if you click Add to Cart then

14
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,300
it will update the quantity of the product in the cart instead.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,150
So now let's go to our cart and now our goal is to make this product persisted so that when we refresh

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,990
the page it will still stay there.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,980
So to do that we have to go back to our editor.

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:27,440
And then you want to cancel your client and then you went to npm install you X persisted state dash

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:36,440
chief and then you want to go to plug ins this will first time creating a plug in file so new file and

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:49,730
name it local storage ideas and then you want to type import create persistent state from view X persistent

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,180
state and export default.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:04,420
Now you add store and your window on NOx ready callback function here and then create persistence date

23
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,050
and an empty bracket in here and then we want to pass the store here

24
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,340
closes down so this library will store the view x state like cart or cart land into the local storage

25
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,120
or cookies so that when we have fresh the page the view X will grab the cart and cart Lang from local

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,750
storage or cookies and store it into view X once again.

27
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,790
So what is going on here.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,160
First important to create persistent state it is a function that has been created by view X persistent

29
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,110
state library.

30
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,280
And then when NOx is ready you in the next app is ready.

31
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,450
We want to pass that store to our cookies or local storage so that it can map the local storage or cookies

32
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,500
back to our store.

33
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,900
So it is just utilizing the local storage or the cookies.

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,680
That's all there is nothing special about it.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
And last thing we want to do is want to go to next conflict.

36
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,070
Yes.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,030
And we have two important plugins.

38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,210
So by adding a plug in as you can read here plugins will load before mounting the application when the

39
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,370
app was about to mount.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,890
Then it will run that specific function which is great persistent state and then it will actually map

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,300
the local storage value or cookies to our view store.

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:27,940
So now we want to add a plug in in here which will be SLC then plug ins then that name or file that

43
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:35,590
we just created which would be storage local storage that yes and then we would add SS are false and

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,220
let's save this and let's go back to our beach and let's refresh the speech.

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:50,400
Oh sorry I need to we need to start a server back which run port nine thousand NPM run death so let's

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,110
go back and let's try to refresh this speech.

47
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,670
Let's tried to add a couple of products

48
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,100
or add this and let's try another product.

49
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,270
You'll be given a truant cart and try to refreshed it

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,330
and it can see the data persisted because we have upgraded our view X to work together with local storage

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,080
and cookies.

52
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,490
This library is amazing.

53
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,750
Or else we have to manually map the view X to local storage and cookies.

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,780
So we go to application and let's check local store it is going to see if you click view X and if you

55
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,010
go down here we make it bigger and you can see that as a cart.

56
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,990
State of state and cart Lang state you can ignore off because of it's already been persistent before

57
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,000
by the library.

58
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,640
But we're going to focus on car and cart length which we persisted in the local storage and it did not

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,370
save in cookies it just save in local storage.

60
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,500
So there's no VFX here so it's only save in local storage.

61
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,440
So right now we don't have the ability to change the quantity of our product and or delete the product

62
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,800
in the next video we will implement the change quantity feature so that user can change the quantity

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,660
of the product.

64
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,500
I'll see you guys in the next video.
