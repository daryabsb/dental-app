00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,250
In this video we will add the ability for the user to delete one of the products in the cart.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,900
Let's go to our index DOJ s and we have to add another mutation function which will be removed.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:26,090
Product let's write the algorithm up here and the algorithm is remove the product quantity from the

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:35,820
cart length and then the second one is get the index of the product that we want to delete.

5
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:45,150
And the final one is remove that product by using splice and in the parameter you want to pass in the

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,510
state and then a product.

7
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,570
And the first we need to remove the products quantity from the cart length.

8
00:00:49,570 --> 00:01:00,070
So do state that cart length minus product quantity.

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,250
After that we want to get the index of a product that we wanted to lead.

10
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:12,970
So let index off product it goes to state the card not index of an end product.

11
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,290
Finally we want to remove that product by using this place.

12
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,260
So state DOT card dots place as in the index of the product.

13
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,000
And then we just want to remove one element from the car every.

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,560
So now we have to call this you know a cart to go to cart a view and that's fine.

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,030
Delete button we can directly call it here.

16
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,020
So at click would you be store

17
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,620
and then the name of the mutation would be removed.

18
00:01:49,610 --> 00:02:00,440
Product and we simply have to pass in the product in save it and we have to make it single quote or

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,400
else we wouldn't work

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,990
because it's already double quote.

21
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,740
So we need to make it single couldn't say who saved is and let's go back to a cart strike to refresh

22
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,510
it first and let's remove one of products remove Harry Potter and there we have it.

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,160
It removes the product and even it removes the product quantity from cart length.

24
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,730
And now the total price is 6 to 3 which is correct can play around with it.

25
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:38,250
We can change and if we refresh a report that won't be there anymore and we have it now we have implemented

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,040
the Add to Cart feature it is working correctly and in the next feed you will implement the payment

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,500
system so we can buy all the products.

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,780
I'll see you guys in the next video.
