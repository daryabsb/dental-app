Hello everybody.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,450
Finally we have come this far where we are going to bill the Add To Cart feature so that our using and

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,440
add products to the cart we need to structure the Schimmel speech first before anything so I have uploaded

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,540
file and lecture and I want to download a file and copy the content so I'm going to open it up and I'm

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,110
going to open a file and you want to copy this entire file and open up your client folder and open Page's

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,630
folder and create a new file and give it a name card and not view and what a piece is here.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,530
Saved it.

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:40,000
And let's go back to a chrome and let's visit local those 9000 cart and see the content.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,710
There we have it.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,460
This is his shopping cart page.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,370
It is the same as Amazon's one.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,520
And if you see this recently viewed items this would be dummy data for the time being.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,560
But this will be related to browsing history later on.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,560
So in this section we are going to focus on building this entire Add To Cart feature.

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,210
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
