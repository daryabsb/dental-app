1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,980
In order for us to map the state to our NAF bar here which is the cart length we need to at getters

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,820
in our index DOJ us file.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,000
So let's go to our editor and you want to type here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,530
Export Carnes getters getters is to get the state.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,080
That's all.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,790
We just want to return to state a map that state corresponding component.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,990
So we need to type for example since we want to get the Lambert car we type GET cart Lang and we pass

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:39,130
interstate and we just wanted to one thing return state DOT cart Lane.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,840
That's all we want.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,490
We just want the value of cart length.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,990
So if we go to nav bar under components and you want to go down you want to type import.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:58,440
Since we have to map the getters to our cart component we have to map getters from view x.

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,270
But how do we map these getters.

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,570
Do we have to put it in methods because method is only for actions.

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,780
But do we put get map getters to data.

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,710
We are not going to map getters.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,980
This doesn't work this way.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:19,600
We have to use computed properties to actually map the getters so that we can use GET cart length.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,570
So you must be wondering what is computed computed property.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,300
Allow us to define a property which is something like get cart length to use the same way as data which

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,350
is it is the same thing as data actually but all the difference is is in computed.

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,620
We can add some custom logic.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,660
So for example in data when we return it's gonna be like name and then we can do any computation here

24
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,180
or we can do any like custom logic in this name property.

25
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,760
But in it you can do name but you have to make it as a function and you have to return and then you

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:06,470
can do any logic you want you can see Jack plus one plus Sparrow so we can use this name property under

27
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:13,020
computed and then we can just simply put it here and then we can just put it like name super simple

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,930
so remember you only want to use compute it if you want to do some logic or you want to do some custom

29
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,440
logic in it like any logic they could think off then you can use compute it.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,660
We never used computer before except right now because we need to map the getters you know compute it

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,730
this is the convention where you cannot map getters to data so you can only map getters to compute it

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,560
hence why we have to use compute it.

33
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,130
But in a future in index the jazz under these getters we're going to have some getter function that

34
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,080
will do some computation kind of make sense to map it to compute it.

35
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:58,030
So right now let's remove this and let's remove this and now we can pass this get cart Lang and we can

36
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:06,400
find a cart which is will be next thing to cart and then this will be get cart length.

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,170
Simple as that.

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,580
It will just return the length of the cart from the state.

39
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,850
So if we go back and go back to our main page and let's add some product into our cart so let's at Harry

40
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:24,730
Potter and I simply click Add to Cart and you can see it increase the cart length is now is three four

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:32,560
five and if you go back to inspect and check our view def tools and you can see if you look the state

42
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:39,550
and now we have one object which is one product and but the quantity is five which is correct.

43
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,100
So we have successfully map the state to the corresponding components in a next video we are going to

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,060
go to cart and we're going to map the cart data to the shopping cart.

45
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,970
So I'll see you guys in the next video.
